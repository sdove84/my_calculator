#### Description

Version 0.1 is the starting point of the Calculator Project. Create the base structure and styles, using bootstrap.  

Version 0.5 adds in user functionality without needing to write the underneath logic of a calculator. With the introduction
to the calculator object the user can interact with the object to receive the values after calculation has been completed.

Version 1 takes the layout and basic button click functionality built in the 2 previous versions and then ties in the calculation functionality. This version works toward more OOP understandings
by taking the inputs from the calculator and inserting them into objects and then those objects into an array.
