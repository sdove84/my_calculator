#### Description

The starting point of the Calculator Project. Create the base structure and styles, using bootstrap.  

Add in user functionality without needing to write the underneath logic of a calculator. With the introduction to the calculator object the user can interact with the object to receive the values after calculation has been completed.

Took the layout and basic button click functionality built in the 2 previous versions and then tied in the calculation functionality. This version works toward more OOP understandings by taking the inputs from the calculator and inserting them into objects and then those objects into an array.
